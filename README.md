# D3-Challenge__Interactive Dashboard built with D3.js - a JavaScript Library  for visualizing data using web standards.__ [divya-gh.github.io/Plotly.ly](https://divya-gh.github.io/Plotly.ly-Challenge/)## Table of contents* [Project Title ](#project-title)* [Description](#description)* [Objective](#objective)* [Screen Shots](#screen-shots)* [Technologies](#technologies)* [Code](#code)* [Status](#status)* [Acknowledgement ](#acknowledgement )* [Contact](#contact)## Project Title : Data Journalism and D3### Description This project aims at building a interactive dashboard for a major metro paper to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives.Charts and graphs feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics.### Data Set- The dataset is from U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.-  Dataset is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau which includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."## Objective### Step 1 - D3 Dabbler- Use python -m http.server to run the visualization and to host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.- Make a webcall using d3.csv promise function.- Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.	* Scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.	* Include state abbreviations in the circles.	* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.### Step 2 - Create an interactive animated scatter chart- Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display.- Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes.- Include 3 risk factors for each axis.- binding all of the CSV data to your circles.- include state Abbr as text inside the circle.### Step 3 - Render ToolTip - Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. - Use the d3-tip.js plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/caged/d3-tip).## Screen Shots### Step 1 - Scatter Plot Healthcare vs. Poverty![Scatter chart](./Images/d3-static.jpg)### Step 2 - Interactive D3 chart with all the Risk factors:![Interactive Chart](./Images/d3-challenge.gif)## Technologies and Tools* Visual Studio Code Editor* GitBash, GitHub , Git Pages* chrome DOM* HTML , CSS, Bootstrap* JavaScript#### Java Script Libraries and pluggins :* D3.js	* D3-tip.js	## Code - [D3 Code](/assets/js/app.js)## Setup- Git clone with HTTPS link- Git bash and run python server to render the page on port 8000- play with the d3 chart- Open [D3 Code](/assets/js/app.js) in visual studio## StatusProject Complete## Acknowledgement - UTSA BootCamp- Jeff Anderson(Boot Camp Instructor for being the best)- [stackoverflow.com for helping with assigning text to circles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44339929/put-text-in-the-middle-of-a-circle-using-d3-js)## Contact [Divya Shetty](https://github.com/divya-gh)
